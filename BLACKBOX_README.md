# Autoregressive Language Model

This code implements an autoregressive language model that has been fine-tuned with instruction-tuning and RLHF. The model is able to generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies, run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the model, first import the necessary libraries and load the model:

```
import os
import torch
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/finetuned-gpt-neo-1.3B")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("EleutherAI/finetuned-gpt-neo-1.3B")
```

Once the model is loaded, you can use it to generate text by providing a prompt. For example, the following code generates a poem about a cat:

```
prompt = "Write a poem about a cat"
output = model.generate(tokenizer.encode(prompt), max_length=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

The model can also be used to translate languages. For example, the following code translates the sentence "Hello world!" into French:

```
prompt = "Translate the sentence 'Hello world!' into French"
output = model.generate(tokenizer.encode(prompt), max_length=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

The model can also be used to write different kinds of creative content, such as stories, poems, and scripts. For example, the following code generates a short story about a detective:

```
prompt = "Write a short story about a detective"
output = model.generate(tokenizer.encode(prompt), max_length=1000)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```

Finally, the model can be used to answer your questions in an informative way. For example, the following code asks the model a question about the capital of France:

```
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"
output = model.generate(tokenizer.encode(prompt), max_length=100)
print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
```
